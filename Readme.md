# About 

This is a **test** project. I'm trying to build some containers that contain everything you need in order to automatically build docker containers from source.

# Components

- *Jenkins* as the BuildServer
- *Registry* as a private docker Registry

# Prerequisites
- Docker (I use 17.12.1-ce)
- Common Sense
- Magic
